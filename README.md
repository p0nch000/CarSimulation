# Multi-Agent Urban Simulation System

## Overview

This project is a multi-agent system that simulates pedestrian behavior on an urban sidewalk. The system models how agents, representing pedestrians, navigate through a street environment, avoiding obstacles and each other while attempting to reach their designated destinations. The system is built using modern technologies to ensure efficiency, scalability, and ease of use.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Used for building an interactive and user-friendly interface. Reactâ€™s component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable UI elements, making it an ideal choice for displaying data and enabling user interaction with the simulation.

- **3D Simulation:** [Unity](https://unity.com/) - The core tool for developing the 3D simulation of the streets, obstacles, and agents. Unity's powerful engine allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive environments that visualize the interactions between pedestrians and urban elements.

- **Multi-Agent System:** [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [PyAgent](https://github.com/your-repo/pyagent) - Python, alongside the PyAgent library, is used to implement the multi-agent systems that simulate pedestrian behavior in response to various obstacles within the urban environment.

- **Backend API:** [Python Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - The API that connects all components of the project is developed in Flask. It handles the communication between the frontend, the 3D simulation, and the multi-agent systems, ensuring seamless integration and efficient data exchange.

## Features

- **Dynamic 3D Simulation:** Visualize how agents navigate a sidewalk with various obstacles in real-time using Unity.
- **Interactive User Interface:** React-based frontend allowing users to interact with the simulation, adjust parameters, and visualize outcomes.
- **Multi-Agent Behavior:** Python-driven agents simulate realistic pedestrian behaviors in response to obstacles and other agents.
- **Scalable Architecture:** The use of Flask ensures that the system can be easily expanded and integrated with other components.
